	"body": "In making the announcement, the prize committee in Stockholm said the work involves a series of brilliant experiments in the 1990s involving baker's yeast that have helped explain how a cell, the smallest unit of life, adapts in response to stresses such as starvation and infection. In studying thousands of yeast mutants, Ohsumi identified 15 genes essential for autophagy. It turned out that virtually identical mechanisms exist in human cells as well.",
